## Getting Started with Geometer's Sketchpad 4.07
 
To start using Geometer's Sketchpad 4.07, you need to download and install it on your computer. You can get a free trial version from [here](https://www.dynamicgeometry.com/Downloads/The_Geometers_Sketchpad_4.html) or buy a full version from [here](https://www.dynamicgeometry.com/Store/Ordering_Information.html). Once you have installed the software, you can launch it by double-clicking on its icon.
 
When you open Geometer's Sketchpad 4.07, you will see a window like this:

The main components of the window are:
 
- The menu bar at the top, which contains various commands and options for working with sketches.
- The toolbar below the menu bar, which contains icons for common tools and actions.
- The sketch area in the center, where you can draw and manipulate geometric objects.
- The status bar at the bottom, which displays information about the current tool, object, or action.
- The scroll bars on the right and bottom edges, which allow you to move around the sketch area.

## Creating and Editing Geometric Objects
 
One of the main features of Geometer's Sketchpad 4.07 is that you can create and edit geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, polygons, angles, measurements, etc. To create an object, you need to select a tool from the toolbar or the menu bar and then click or drag on the sketch area. For example, to create a point, you can select the Point tool and then click anywhere on the sketch area. To create a line segment, you can select the Segment tool and then click on two points or drag from one point to another.
 
To edit an object, you can select it by clicking on it or dragging a selection box around it. You can then move it by dragging it with the mouse or use other tools or commands to modify its properties. For example, to move a point, you can select it and then drag it to a new location. To change its color, you can select it and then choose a color from the Color menu.
 
You can also create relationships between objects by using tools such as Perpendicular Bisector, Midpoint, Parallel Line, etc. These relationships are dynamic, meaning that they will be preserved even if you move or change the objects involved. For example, if you create a perpendicular bisector of a segment by using the Perpendicular Bisector tool, then the bisector will always remain perpendicular to the segment even if you move or resize the segment.
 
## Exploring and Investigating Geometric Properties
 
Another feature of Geometer's Sketchpad 4.07 is that you can explore and investigate geometric properties by using tools such as Measure Distance, Measure Angle, Trace Point, Locus Plotter, etc. These tools allow you to measure various quantities and observe how they change when you manipulate the objects in your sketch. For example, if you want to measure the length of a segment, you can select it and then choose Measure Distance from the Measure menu. A measurement box will appear on your sketch showing the length of the segment. If you move or resize the segment, the measurement box will update accordingly.
 
You can also use these tools to test conjectures and discover patterns in geometry. For example, if you want to investigate whether the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, you can create a triangle by using the
