## License Types
 
VMware NSX for vSphere 6.x and 7.x offers different license types depending on your needs and use cases. The license types are:
 
- **NSX Enterprise Plus:** This is the most comprehensive license type that provides all the features and capabilities of VMware NSX, such as distributed routing, firewalling, load balancing, VPN, service insertion, automation, and operations management. This license type is based on the number of CPUs on the ESXi hosts that are part of the NSX domain.
- **NSX Data Center SP:** This is a license type designed for service providers who participate in the VMware Cloud Provider Program (VCPP). This license type provides similar features as NSX Enterprise Plus, but with some additional benefits such as usage-based billing, multi-tenancy support, and cross-cloud networking. This license type is based on the number of virtual machines that are protected by NSX.
- **Add-On Licenses:** These are optional licenses that provide additional functionality on top of the base licenses. For example, you can use an add-on license to enable NSX Advanced Load Balancer (formerly Avi Networks) or NSX Federation. These licenses are also based on the number of CPUs or virtual machines depending on the base license.
